# UEFI-based malware
Repository related to the Cybersecurity Master's thesis UPC 2023/2024 for the simple UEFI malware application chapter. The program has been coded in C language for a X64(Intel and AMD 64bits) using the UEFI EDK2 firmware framework utilities for EFI applications development. 

## Files:
- UEAFIapp.c: Source code for the simple UEFI malware application, the program tampers with the EFI and ext4 filesystems of the device, it also reads the contents of /etc/shadow file if located.
- UEFIapp.inf: The INF file is required by the EDKII build system to describe a moduleâ€™s behavior, such as produced or consumed library classes, protocols and other information.
- UEFIapp.dsc: The function of the DSC file is to specify the library instances, components and output formats used to generate binary files that will be processed by other tools to generate an image.
- setup.sh: Script for the installation of the EDK2 dev kit.
- build.sh: Script to build the EFI binary of the UEFIapp.c program.
- grub.cfg: GRUB2 configuration file used to automatically execute the UEFIapp.efi binary upon OS loading.
 
## EDK2 Installation:
Execute with admin privileges the script setup.sh, which will download the EDK2 dev kit from the tianocore's repository and install it.

## Compilation:
Execute the script build.sh located in the folder where the source code is. It will build and create the EFI binaries related to the program targeted.
